### 👩‍💻 About the Project  
This bank card UI was created to explore interactive design and animation in JavaScript. I wanted to build something that feels modern and functional—like a digital wallet preview. It helped me dive deeper into CSS transforms, event listeners, and dynamic DOM updates. Plus, it’s just cool to see the card flip like that!
