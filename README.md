# 💳 Dynamic Bank Card – JavaScript Practice Project 💡  
An interactive bank card UI built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. This project displays real-time card details directly on the card and features a smooth 3D flip animation to reveal the CVV2 on hover. It’s a sleek way to practice DOM manipulation, transitions, and responsive design.
